## Introduction
A brief overview of what SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) is, its purpose in RDF graph validation, and why it’s significant in the context of semantic web and data validation.

## Project Overview
An explanation of the contents of this repository, which may include:
- Slide deck for the SHACL presentation.
- Examples of SHACL usage with Turtle and JSON-LD.
- Sample SHACL validation scripts and reports.
- Supporting resources and links.

## Presentation Outline
A breakdown of the slide content in the presentation:
1. **Introduction to SHACL** – Overview of the language and its purpose.
2. **Terminology** – Definitions of key terms used in SHACL.
3. **Document Conventions** – Overview of namespaces and visual aids in SHACL documentation.
4. **SHACL Example** – Step-by-step example showing SHACL validation.
5. **Shapes and Constraints** – Explanation of shapes and constraint types.
6. **Targets** – Overview of target declarations.
7. **Validation and Graphs** – The validation process in SHACL.
8. **Core Constraint Components** – Summary of built-in constraint components.
9. **SHACL-SPARQL** – Description of SHACL-SPARQL for advanced constraints.

## Examples and Demos
A folder or section containing SHACL examples, including:
- Validation scripts.
- Example RDF graphs and SHACL shapes.
- Sample output reports.

## Getting Started
Instructions on how users can run the examples and demos, including:
1. **Prerequisites** – Any tools or libraries needed (e.g., Apache Jena, SHACL validators).
2. **Installation** – Setup instructions for running SHACL validation locally.
3. **Running Examples** – Command-line instructions or code snippets for running provided examples.

## Resources
A curated list of additional resources, including:
- SHACL documentation and tutorials.
- Relevant tools (e.g., SHACL validators).
- Semantic web resources related to RDF and SPARQL.
